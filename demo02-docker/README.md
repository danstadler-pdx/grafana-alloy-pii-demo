# Demo 2 - using Docker

## Work in progress:
There is a branch called "build-demo02" which is now available if you want to test it out. The [README is here](https://github.com/danstadler-pdx/grafana-alloy-pii-demo/tree/build-demo02/demo02-docker).

You would just clone this repo, switch to that branch, and then try out the instructions on that page.

It's still very early so don't expect full stability yet - but hopefully it works for you - please submit issues or PRs if you have feedback.
